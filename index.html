It patiently hides it in the deep layers of the earth, which enrich it with all essential minerals. Hidden in the depths of solid sedimentary and quartz rocks on the slopes of the Gledić mountains in the heart of Šumadija, it wisely collects all the minerals that our body needs for better health and a better quality of life.
                                This unique SUBARTE water was discovered in 2001, and based on research and monitoring of the immutability of water parameters, it was scientifically established that it is water of GLACIER ORIGIN, very old and from a depth of over 1,500 meters.
                                The origin, the very quality of Oaza water and the method of exploitation makes it unique in our region, so it is rightfully classified as one of the highest quality waters in the world, which is directly bottled from the depths of nature, without any processing.</p>

                                At a depth of over 60m, in the geographical heart of Serbia. Unspoiled nature has given all the exceptional properties to the water of the Oaza. The source, discovered more than two decades ago, provides water of the highest quality, thanks to many years of natural filtration through layers of granite and limestone from the slopes of the Gledić mountains.

                                Clean water is certainly the most important prerequisite for a healthy, high-quality and long life.
                                Of the small % of the world's drinking water, only 0.26% of that amount is available for use without any processing, and it belongs to EXTREMELY DRINKING WATER.
                                This small % also includes Oaza water.
                                This water belongs to the group of Glacier waters, which circulate through the earth's crust like river vessels, are filtered naturally, passing through different layers of the earth (rocks, limestone) and as such create a natural mineral balance. It is this ratio of essential minerals that promotes a healthy lifestyle and the natural purity of perfect mineral water.</p>

                                    Based on the opinion of sports doctors, due to the rapid absorption of water in the body, it is especially recommended for athletes and people who are exposed to heavy physical efforts.

                                    OAZA water is high-quality drinking water, with excellent organoleptic, physical-chemical and biological characteristics. Thanks to the ideal ratio of calcium and magnesium, as well as sulfates with a low value of potassium and sodium, the water has an ideally balanced ratio of minerals, which is excellent for the proper development of bones in children, and in adults it favors the proper functioning of the heart, reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and replaces calcium that is lost due to old age, smoking and other unhealthy habits.
                                    Magnesium plays a very important role in binding calcium to bones and in muscle relaxation. It also participates in regulating heart rhythm and lowering cholesterol levels. This trace element regulates the work of the intestines, especially in case of constipation. In pregnant women, it reduces the risk of spontaneous abortion and premature birth.

                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">Recommendations for water intake</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">The required amount of water depends on other factors besides age and sex. Pregnancy and lactation in women, as well as extreme environmental temperatures and increased physical activity increase the body's need for water. According to the European Food Safety Agency, the appropriate total water intake for adults is 2L per day for women and 2.5L for men*. Adequate hydration is necessary for the normal functioning of the body. This is exactly why Oaza water, with its unique mineral composition and impeccable, pristine purity, is a valuable gift of nature, and you can enjoy its exceptional quality every day.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">Study and work</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Water contributes to the normal development of cognitive functions, and insufficient hydration is associated with reduced concentration, fatigue and headaches. Therefore, proper water intake is a good foundation for overcoming intellectual challenges.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">Sports and recreation</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Water contributes to the normal development of body functions and thermoregulation, which is extremely important for athletes and recreational people. Exercise can multiply water loss through sweating, even more than 1l per hour.</p>

                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">MINERAL COMPOSITION OF WATER AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Oaza water belongs to the sources where people had no influence when the water basin was created and represents a real treasure because it is an untouched part of nature that is exploited. This water is declared as naturally mineral water and as such must not be treated with any chemical preparations before bottling, but must only be filtered from the source to the bottle.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Because of its pure and untouched nature this water can be bottled directly from the source, so that none of its precious properties are lost. The waters from this area belong to waters of medium low mineralization, which means that they can be drunk daily in unlimited quantities.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">PERFECTLY BALANCED COMPOSITION OF MINERALS</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">What contributes to the optimal functioning of the organism and physiological processes are compounds with an extremely characteristic chemical composition, i.e. minerals. The body needs them for various functions, for growth, development, energy, hemoglobin production, oxygen transport, building strong teeth and bones, proper functioning of kidneys, muscles and nerves. Minerals make up 4.5% of our body mass, and each has its own specific function and are closely related to each other. Some that are of great importance for us and our body are sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Sodium is an essential element for the health and functioning of the body while potassium is another mineral that the body needs.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Daily use of Oaza water improves internal body functions, stimulates the immune, nervous, digestive and cardiovascular systems and additionally strengthens the possibility of skin and body regeneration. The most abundant element in our body is calcium, where 99% is located in bones and 1% in soft tissues. Calcium plays a major role in the functioning of the bone-muscle system, protects us from a decline in immunity and contributes to the building of bones and teeth. It is important for muscle contractions, the transmission of nerve signals, but also for the secretion of hormones and enzymes. Magnesium also affects how we feel and how healthy we are. With a sufficient amount of magnesium, our mood stabilizes, we sleep better and are more energetic. It is needed by the heart, nerves and muscles, and thus represents a major contribution to the normal functioning of metabolic processes in the body. It is also called an anti-stress mineral, and it helps us in states of tension and nervousness in optimal amounts.</p>

                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT WATER FOR YOU?</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">The composition that is important for our health is written on the declaration of bottled water. However, not all bottled water is the same. If we are looking for water that we can consume all day, without restrictions, then it is important that it is indicated on the declaration of the water that we drink, and that such water is low-mineral. This means that it contains a low percentage of sodium, a good ratio of calcium and magnesium and other macro and microelements.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">WHY?</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Low-mineral waters do not burden the body, are quickly absorbed, help faster hydration and stimulate metabolism in the body. The most important thing in the composition of water is that all elements and minerals work synergistically.Calcium and magnesium should be in the ratio that is most desirable for our body, because when balanced in this way, they can act synergistically and affect all enzymatic reactions in the body, more precisely, they can be absorbed and affect muscles and bones. Precisely because of the excellent ratio of Ca and Mg, Oaza water is recommended for consumption by both children and adults, as it encourages proper bone development and affects the proper functioning of the heart. Given that it is low in minerals, Oaza water can be used by pregnant women, as well as babies and small children, without worrying about restrictions on consumption.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s bold">THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN?</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">As we all already know, water is the single most important substance on the planet that we cannot live without. Life originated in water, we start our day with it, we maintain our organism with it. Regardless of the period of life we are in. As we are aware of the importance of hydration and the intake of a sufficient amount of fluids for both the elderly and children, especially for their growth and development. Like a healthy diet, water is necessary for the healthy growth of children.If you are wondering if there is a limit to the daily intake of Oaza water for children, we have good news. Oaza water contains enough minerals needed for the good daily functioning of the body, but it also belongs to low-mineral water, which is of particular importance, because only low-mineral water can be consumed by adults, children and even pregnant women in unlimited quantities.</p>

                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">Although water is necessary for all ages, special importance and attention should be directed to expectant mothers, as well as to women in labor, for whom water plays an important and significant role in the growth of the baby, since it contributes to its good hydration and supply of nutrients. Due to all the changes that take place in the body of pregnant women, the consumption of water eases most of the symptoms of the second condition, both psychological and physical. If you drink enough water, your face stays hydrated and fresh, and your skin is soft and shiny.</p>
                            <p class="horizontal__paragraph text-s">After giving birth, it is extremely important that mothers commit to a healthy lifestyle, a regulated diet, and intake of sufficient amounts of water. Water, stimulating the production of milk and affecting its quality, is an essential factor in the baby's diet. For this reason, its intake during breastfeeding is necessary in order for your child to develop normally and grow healthily.Oaza water can be bottled at the source itself, so that none of its precious properties are lost, that is, so that magnesium plays its role in biological reactions, and calcium enables the transmission of nerve impulses and the control of muscle contractions.</p>

                    <p class="image__paragraph text-s">The amount of water you need to drink during the day depends on many different factors such as gender, age, climate, diet, physical activity, health status.

                        The general recommendation is between 8 and 15 glasses of water per day without restrictions on consumption, i.e. low-mineral water. Thanks to its composition, Oaza water is one of those low-mineral waters that you can enjoy all day without restrictions, even during pregnancy.
                        
                        If you are training, it is necessary to make an optimal schedule of water consumption during the day. During training, you should drink 100-250 ml of water every 15-20 minutes, and after physical activity, 400-450 ml every hour, depending on its strength and length. During physical activity, the body loses water, so it is important to provide the body with enough hydration so that the training is effective for the whole organism.</p>
